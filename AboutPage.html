        <br>
        <p>United Bikers Portal is developed for the purpose of easy communication between world-wide bikers or racers.
            <br> Communication and security is a huge problem because, there is always a threat of getting scammed.
            <br> That's why, here, you are free to communicate with the seller or the buyer or the partner you are loooking forward 
            to join in a road trip, at your own personal level. 
            <br> Also, it is all upto you, if you want to share your loaction (buyer) or if you want to share any details of your own.
            <br> We suggest, your purchase and delivery should be made in physical modes rather than virtual ones in order to 
            avoid any threats to yourself. 
            <br> However, we gurantee safety and security to you.
            <br> Along the way, we plan to shake hands with a few travel agencies so that you can enjoy your road trips 
            in a well planned and safe manner.
            <br> We look forward to involve more and more people in our community.
            <br> We hope you have a great time with us.
        </p>
